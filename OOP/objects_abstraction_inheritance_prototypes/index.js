 * Circle(sub class) IS-A Shape(parent class)

 * If any array is created [], it has a protoype, say arrayBase
 * which has methods like push, pull, index, indexOf etc
 * This arrayBase also has another prototype which is objectBase
 * Remeber this objectBase is the base object of everything in Js
 *
 * Same with creating Objects(say Circle, Rectangle) from a constructor (say, Shape)
 * All object created from this constructor has common prototype with properties
 * "constructor(which is the fcn were created from)" and "another protoytpeObject"
 * which is the objectBase in Js
